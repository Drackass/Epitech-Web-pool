                <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[9] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.[10][11] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.[12] PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page,[13][14] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[15]
